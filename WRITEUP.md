### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*

App Service is perfect suitable for lightweight and cost-conscious applications. 
As no vastly growth for the service is expected, App Service is also in this point the better choice.
The availability is also better for the App Service as one doesn't need to worry about the OS.
The workflow is easier with an App Service as I do not have any special requirements (security concerns, ...). 

- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*

I choose the App Service.

- *Justify your choice*

The choice was already justifed by comparing the above criteria.


### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

If a vastly growth is expected or special security concerns apply, a VM would be the better choice.
